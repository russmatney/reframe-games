#+TITLE: Re-frame Games

* A tetris clone in Re-frame/Reagent (CLJS), and other games
* todo
** [X] support pieces 'falling' into the screen
when a piece's shape is more than a cell tall, it should enter one row at a time
I think this can be mocked with 'phantom' rows above the board
these rows need to be added to the board and ignored/handled in the right places
** [ ] deploy to start getting feedback and feature ideas
** [ ] build up a puzzle? pixelated art?
** [ ] replay or highlights feature?
** [ ] fix prod build to exclude shadow warning
** [ ] fix keybindings not working on firefox
** [ ] mobile touch/gesture support?
