#+TITLE: Reframe Games

Games built in ClojureScript, with [[https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent][Reagent]], [[https://github.com/day8/re-frame][Re-frame]], [[https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs][Shadow-cljs]], and
[[https://github.com/nostalgic-css/NES.css][NES.css]].

This repo will be expanded to include other games, but for now, it's just a
Tetris clone. Check out the live game at [[https://russmatney.itch.io/tetruss][russmatney.itch.io/tetruss]].

* Tetruss
The [[https://tetris.wiki][Tetris Wiki]] has some great Tetris related resources.

* Contributing
My intention for this repository is to build some things from scratch on my
own - selfishly, I'm somewhat closed-minded to contributions.

I'm open to talking about the things in here via PRs and Issues, and I encourage
you to fork and do what you want with the code!

My motivation for developing this in the public:
- to share the code as an example
- to get feedback
- (hopefully) to inspire others to build things!
