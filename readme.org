#+TITLE:   Re-frame Tetris

* A tetris clone in Re-frame/Reagent (CLJS)
* todo
** [ ] support pieces 'falling' into the screen
when a piece's shape is more than a cell tall, it should enter one row at a time
I think this can be mocked with 'phantom' rows above the board
these rows need to be added to the board and ignored/handled in the right places
